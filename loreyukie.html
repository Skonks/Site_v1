                Yukie Mayuzumi (黛 由紀江) is one of the main heroines in Maji De Watashi Ni Koi Shinasai! anime and manga.
                She is a newcomer to the Kazama Family who has the ambition to make one hundred friends, the daughter of
                Taisei
                Mayuzumi and one of the love interests to Yamato Naoe in Majikoi! and Majikoi! S.
                Yukie is the recent and latest addition to the Four Devas, a group made of the strongest fighters in the
                world. This is a fact that is relatively unknown to the public however, due to Yukie's withdrawn
                personality.
                Yukie is a fighter of most special interest to Momoyo Kawakami due to her strength and potential with
                Momoyo watching for her development with a desire to face Yukie in a decent fight.
                Yukie represents Respect (礼, Rei), one of the seven virtues of martial arts.

                Yukie is a fairly tall and soft pale-skinned girl with thigh-length deep forest-green hair that is tied
                in two low pigtails by two white ribbons with square bangs, dark blue eyes, a voluptuous figure, she
                keeps herself well kept that gives off a yamato nadeshiko aura and it has been commentated that she has
                a great butt (by Yamato Naoe and Momoyo Kawakami) that even most of the merchandises involving her
                emphasizes it.

            <h3>Matsukaze</h3>
            <p>
                A black horse cell phone strap which belongs to Yukie where he was made by Taisei Mayuzumi just for her
                due to her shy personality.
                Despite being an object, Matsukaze became Yukie’s first friend. Matsukaze claimed that he is a spirit
                that has possessed the cell phone strap but in reality it's just Yukie performing ventriloquism.
                Yukie says that since she had no friends, she ended up talking to the object and that one day, it talked
                back to her, leading to the birth of Matsukaze.
