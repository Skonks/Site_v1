                Yukie Mayuzumi (黛 由紀江) is one of the main heroines in Maji De Watashi Ni Koi Shinasai! anime and manga.
                She
                is a newcomer to the Kazama Family who has the ambition to make one hundred friends, the daughter of
                Taisei
                Mayuzumi and one of the love interests to Yamato Naoe in Majikoi! and Majikoi! S.

                Yukie is the recent and latest addition to the Four Devas, a group made of the strongest fighters in the
                world. This is a fact that is relatively unknown to the public however, due to Yukie's withdrawn
                personality.

                Yukie is a fighter of most special interest to Momoyo Kawakami due to her strength and potential with
                Momoyo
                watching for her development with a desire to face Yukie in a decent fight.

                Yukie represents Respect (礼, Rei), one of the seven virtues of martial arts.
